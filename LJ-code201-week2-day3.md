The last two days have felt like a disaster.  I'm still pressing forward trying to grind through these labs. Honestly, I'm having more and more doubts all the time except that I'm more mindful of how I'm feeling and doing better about stopping the negative thoughts.  I Googled more Youtube videos on grit.  It's a nice respite from banging my head against the wall.  I need to take more walks.  Also, I've enlisted the help of a friend developer who is well-versed in javascript and coding.  

Still fuzzy on this week's topic - the DOM.
