Today we reviewed this week's topics - manipulating the DOM, constructor functions, and object literals.

I felt like I overcame a huge mental and emotional block yesterday after Brook and Brandy facilitated a discussion on self-confidence and efficacy.  I got a lot of my fears off my chest.  After that, I was able to talk to Brian for about 30 minutes regarding my progress in the class as well as career focus.  It was a good day.
