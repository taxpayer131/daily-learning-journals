Today we were introduced to the Document Object Model, or D.O.M. for short.  The DOM is a way for anyone to modify the elements within an HTML document.  Conceptually, I understand it.  Functionally, I'm still fumbling around with everything in this course.

I learned it's extremely important at this stage to comment as much of my code as possible so as to turn my work into teachable moments or when I have to refer back to my work for reminders.

I'm learning to Google just about everything and take FOREVER just to write a few lines of code.  Then there's the testing of my code which usually results in at least 30 more minutes of Google-ing and experimentation/testing.

Frustration is becoming less and less of a thing, though.  I'm slowing coming around to staying focused and keeping calm throughout the learning process.
