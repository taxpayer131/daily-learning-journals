In the two days I've been at this, I find myself teetering on the edge of
confusion and somewhat stressed.  My recall is poor when the labs roll around
and I realized that I need to start taking notes by hand since trying to type
important points in class is distracting to me, especially if I make a typo.

It kind of stresses me out that I have a Win10 laptop, too.  Fortunately, my sister
gave me her old Mac Pro (it's nine years old!) leaving me optimistic that
hardware won't be a problem for the rest of Code 201.

My time management sucks.  I feel like I'm ADD times 10.  I can't stay focused
on any one task, there's so much to learn and be accomplished.  As such, I feel
like I need to spend more time outside of class working on the lab.  Not really sure
what to do about that, but I had a talk with my wife about it this afternoon.  She's agreed to help me out by assuming the parental duties for most of tomorrow allowing
me to stay at school and get a rhythm going.  We'll see how that goes.

Today I learned how to set up a website using HTML, create a javascript
application, and then create formatting of a webpage using CSS.
