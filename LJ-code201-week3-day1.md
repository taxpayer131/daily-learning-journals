Every day gets harder, but today was truly difficult as I didn't sleep at all last night and I'm still taking a long time to grind out assignments.  Today we learned how to insert audio and video files into our mark-up.  I don't normally compare my own progress with others, but today I spoke to someone in the class who is truly more lost than me.  I don't know where I'd be in this class if I didn't already have IT experience.
