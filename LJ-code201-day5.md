I started out today feeling really good about the last 24 hours.  I was paired up with a strong pair-programming partner yesterday and was able to learn a lot while, for the first time this week, finishing a lab before leaving for the day.

That was all blown away beginning with the 10-minute HTLML/CSS exercise where we had to build as much of the HTML page on the whiteboard as possible.  I felt pretty dejected despite Brian's stated expectation (he didn't expect many of us to get far).  The rest of the day kind of fell apart from there.

I had a good chat with Brian after lecture ended for the day, though.  I'm keeping my head up, still trying.  I'm going to take time this weekend to relax, review, and do my best to prepare for next week.  Now that the initial shock is starting to wear down, I'm going to bear down and stay the course.
